# fb-group-word-blacklist-post-remover

This script use blacklisted words to remove all posts that match that word, also muting author of post for 28days.
I created this script because so many people in my group sharing "Dwayne Johnson giveaways", "Novak Djokovic"...

How to use?
1. Install python 2.7 via anaconda or manual.
2. Install selenium webdriver: pip install -U selenium
3. Install chrome webdriver.
4. python censor.py to start script.
